## Installation & Setup of Keplr Wallet

### 1. Browser Extension Download:
   - Navigate to your browser's extension or add-on store (e.g., Chrome Web Store for Google Chrome, Firefox Add-ons for Mozilla Firefox).
   - Search for "Keplr Wallet".
   - Click on "Add to [Browser]" and confirm any prompts to install the extension.

### 2. Launching the Wallet:
   - After installation, locate the Keplr Wallet icon in your browser's toolbar and click on it to initiate the wallet interface.

### 3. Initial Setup:
   - Upon launch, you'll encounter a welcome screen.
   - You'll have the option to either "Create New Wallet" or "Import Existing Wallet".

### 4. Creating a New Wallet:
   - If "Create New Wallet" is selected, you'll be prompted to generate a seed phrase.
   - It's imperative to securely store this seed phrase as it's the main key to recover your wallet.
   - Set a password for an added layer of security within your browser.

### 5. Importing an Existing Wallet:
   - For "Import Existing Wallet", you'll need to input your previously established seed phrase.
   - You'll also have the opportunity to set (or reset) a password for the wallet within the browser.

## Important Considerations

### Backup Recommendations:
   - Always ensure multiple copies of your seed phrase are stored in safe, offline locations (e.g., paper, offline storage devices).
   - Never share your seed phrase with anyone, even if they claim to be from the Keplr support team. 

### Extension Authenticity:
   - Be cautious of phishing attempts. Always double-check the extension's publisher and reviews before downloading.
   - Bookmark the official Keplr or related web pages to avoid visiting malicious sites.

### Further Learning & Resources:
   - For detailed functionalities, troubleshooting, or advanced features, refer to the official Keplr documentation or community forums.
   - Developers looking for integrations or API access can explore associated libraries and SDKs, if available, for enhanced dApp integration.
